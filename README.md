A **CobWeb plot** is this amazing representation method that shows how a simple recurrence relation evolves and highlights the role of attractors. 

In this example, we focus on a basic recurrence: $u_{n+1} = f(u_n)$ with a specific kind of iterator ```f```: a piecewise linear function.  

Its properties can be adjusted at will, the outcome is shown instantaneously.
